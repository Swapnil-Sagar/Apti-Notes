Formula's For Problems On Trains

1. Time taken by a train of length X meters to pass a pole or standing man or a signal post is = the time taken by the train to cover X meters. 

2. Time taken by a train of length X meters to pass a stationary object of length b meters is = the time taken by the train to cover (X+ b) meters. 

3. Suppose two trains or two objects bodies are moving in the same direction at u m/s and v m/s, where u > v, then their relative speed is = (u - v) m/s. 

4. Suppose two trains or two objects bodies are moving in opposite directions at u m/s and v m/s, then their relative speed is = (u + v) m/s. 

5. If two trains of length a meters and b meters are moving in opposite directions at um/s and v m/s, then: 

The time taken by the trains to cross each other = (a + b) / (u + v)  sec

6. If two trains of length a meters and b meters are moving in the same direction at um/s and v m/s, then: 

The time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train = (a + b) / (u - v) sec

7. If two trains (or bodies) start at the same time from points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take a and b sec in reaching B and A respectively, then: 

 (A's speed) : (B's speed) = (√ b: √a )
